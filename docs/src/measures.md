# Measures

The Measures have been divided into calcMetrics and boolmetrics depending on whether the metric returns Numerical value or Boolean value respectively.

MLJFair._ftIdx is a utility function that has been used to calculate metrics and shall be helpful while using MLJFair to inspect Fairness tensor values.
